# Diamond Rails
A mod that makes minecarts and rails viable as late-game transport, adding three new types of powered rails far faster than vanilla.

## Rails
### Powered rails (Vanilla, unchanged)
Top speed of **8 blocks a second**.
### Diamond rails
Top speed of **40 blocks a second**.
Crafted with the same recipe as powered rails, but with diamonds instead of gold.
### Enhanced diamond rails
Top speed of **80 blocks a second**.
Crafted by upgrading a diamond rail with a lapis block and a chorus fruit in a smithing table.
### Netherite rails
Top speed of **159.66 blocks a second** ([real-life world speed record for a wheeled high speed train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_speed_record#Conventional_wheeled), 574.8 km/h aka 159.66 m/s).
Crafted by upgrading an enhanced diamond rail with a netherite smithing upgrade and a netherite ingot in a smithing table.

## Building railways
- It is currently impossible to turn corners or go uphill/downhill while travelling on any modded rails. 
  - Instead, use vanilla powered rails to slow minecarts down before turning corners, and use vanilla powered rails to go uphill. Go downhill using normal/powered rails so you don't go flying off the track.
- Ideally, tracks should be straight and flat.
- The rails are actually not as expensive as you might think, as a couple Diamond/Enhanced rails can give a minecart enough momentum for hundreds of blocks, or thousands for Netherite rails.


## Potential future additions
- Copper rails (unsure what level I'll put these at)
- Possibly outright buff default vanilla rail speed
- Uphill/downhill on the mod's rails
